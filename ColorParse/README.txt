This is ColorParse for the CSE!

How does it work, you say? Well, if you ever were playing a game using xLIBC and thought "Man, I wish I knew the value of that color! It's too hard for me to search for its exact value in IntCPick!", this is the thing for you!
Simply Unarchive the program, add "pgrmCLRPRSE" to the place where the color would be, and launch the the program. Once the runner is executed, a pixel will pop up in the top left corner of the screen. Move this pixel around with arrows or faster with number keys and press 2ND or ENTER. The color value of that pixel will be saved to V. After that, just exit with CLEAR.
Simply use RCL V to use it.
Press GRAPH while in color parse to display V's value at the bottom corner.
Remove "pgrmCLRPRSE" and Archive CLRPRSE and you're good to go!
I hope you find this handy!
