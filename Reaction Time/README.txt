Welcome to Reaction Time! This is a simple game that helps you test your reaction skills and as well as have fun! Rack up that high score and challenge your friends!
When you start the game, 4 numbers will spawn. Press the numbers before the circles around them shrink and disappear! If a circle shrinks or you press the wrong button, you lose. Once you get to 136 numbers, you win an get an extra 50 points added to your score.
Around each number is a green circle. The circles can only be gotten every 5 levels. If you get a number while the red circle is exactly on the green circle, you get 2 points instead of one!
