Welcome to Super BASIC! Made by mets11rap!

This is a simple program which allows you to write programs WAY faster! It converts special commands, prefixes, keys, and data into a fully working BASIC program.

In the start menu, you're able to configure settings. These will enable/disable the use of any of the classes of data. Press the numbers on the keypad labeled to the options to toggle them and simply press CLEAR when done.
Once done configuring the settings, go to the convert option and type in the READ program and a non-existent program which it creates and writes to and it will do the rest for you! It will even time the seconds (This does not slow down the conversion.)!

NOTES ABOUT THE INPUTS BEFORE CONVERSION
Putting in a nonexistent READ program will quit.
If the READ program and WRITE program are the same, it will quit.
If the WRITE program already exists, it will prompt you with a continue question. "Add on" will push the previous code in the program down. "Overwrite" will, well, overwrite it.

1 Line notes:
A singular key can only be used once on each line. (":)(9+"HI"→)(9:" would not work while "":)RSHI"→)(9" would.)
With all the settings on, each line is ~1s.

Documentation:

To prevent a file from being read by the converter, simply have "[LOCK]" as the first line. (This is pretty much only useful for AppVars because if the person has Doors, they can unlock it. (You also can't have an icon.))

The first line of the READ program is the title. i (The imaginary number symbol) must be the start of the line. iTEST would make the WRITE program TEST. If there is no specification, the WRITE program will automatically be "1CONV".

[COMMANDS Used as THE line. Anything after them will be deleted WITH EXCEPTIONS! Starred commands MUST have something after them.
|/P = Pause
|/P Will turn into Pause 
|
|/I = Invert
|/I Will turn into real(0,3,2 which inverts the colors of the screen.
|
|/CD = ClrDraw
|/CD Will turn into ClrDraw
|
|/CH = ClrHome
|/CH Will turn into ClrHome
|
|/K = getKey*
|/KK Will turn into getKey→K
|
|/L = Lbl*
|/L24 Will turn into Lbl 24
|
|/G = Goto*
|/GH Will turn into Goto H
|
|//VARFn = +/- 1
|//A+ Will turn into A+1→A and //A- Will turn into A-1→A (This works for * and -, but they're pointless.)
|
|/XS = xLIBC Setup
[/XS Will turn into real(0,1,1:real(8,1,0 which sets up normal halfmode for xLIBC

[PREFIXES Used at the beginning (- is used as the second index) of the line.
|. = real(
|.7,5,0,0,10,10,0 Will turn into real(7,5,0,0,10,10,0
|Don't worry about periods/decimals in numbers/sentences because it pays attention to context.
|TIP: When storing .# to a number, just put 0.# so it doesn't turn into a real(.
|
|-(Negative Sign) = det( *(Must have text before (Ans) and after.)
|0-0 Will turn into 0:det(0
|This, as well, pays attention to context.
|TIP: When using a det( without an Ans required, just use det( from the catalog.
|
|* = Disp 
|*)(9 Will turn into Disp Str9
[*"HI" Will turn into Disp "HI"

[KEYS Used anywhere in the line.
|)(# = String
|"DATA"→)(9: (DATA must be in quotes) Will turn into "DATA"→Str9
|
|)RS = rowSwap(
|")RSHELLO" Will turn into "rowSwap(HELLO"
|
|)L = L(List L)
|)LHELLO Will turn into LHELLO
|
|)> = Filled Arrow
|)> Will turn into a filled arrow
|
|)A = Ans
[*)A Will turn into "Disp Ans"

A closing bracket at the beginning of a line will prevent detection on that line.

NOTE: Doing anything wrong will show a syntax error in the program, but I assure you, something's wrong with your program. You can check where the WRITE program left off to see where it errored.
