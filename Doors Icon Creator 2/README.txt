THIS WAS ORIGINALLY MADE BY TIFREAK8x. I simply modified it to fix some things that annoyed me and added editing and some other things.

Doors Icon creator! Simply enter in the name of a program. If the program doesn't exist it will prompt you asking to create it. The editor will open up and you'll be able to create an icon for your program. If an icon already exists, it will prompt you with the option to edit your icon!
Press ZOOM to invert the colors.
