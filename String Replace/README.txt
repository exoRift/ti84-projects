Welcome to StringReplace. This is the thing you always wanted! It's super easy. You can find a specific series of characters and replace them with anything super fast!

How to use:

Str9=String
Str8=What to find
Str7=What to replace found things with

How to use in a program:
CSE:
Input Str9
Input Str8
Input Str7
"STRREP":det(11,0,1
prgmXTEMP001
CE:
Input Str9
Input Str8
Input Str7
prgmSTRREP

Alternatively, you can use the REPLACE program provided to quickly use it like a tool rather than a library. (CSE only)

Hope you enjoy!
