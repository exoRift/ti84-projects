For those of you who code on your calculator directly, this is an integer color mixer for the TI-84 Plus CSE. (Mainly used for reals.) Simply move the cursor around and select the color you want. When you press 2ND or Enter, it will display the value and save the value to V.
Y= to switch between black and white backgrounds
WINDOW to set hovering color as background
