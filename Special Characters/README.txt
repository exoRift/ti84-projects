This is special characters! Special characters is a really simply program which saves a bunch of special characters you can't get through normal means to any string of your choice to use for your programs!
Simply open it and press a number (0-9) which will correspond to the string you wish to save it to!
DOES NOT REQUIRE DOORS
The list of characters you can get are as follows:
1. #
2. $
3. %
4. &
5. ;
6. @
7. \
8. ... (As one character)
To use these, simply use RCL and the string.
